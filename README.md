# shower_cabinet_pole_cap
3D printed plastic cap to cover sharp edges on top of the aluminum pole holding shower cabinet together

# Plastic finish at the top of aluminium profile 

The corner metal poles which usally are made in aluminium have usally sharp edges at the top, and it is therefore practical to attach an soft plastic end on these to avoid that textiles (towels) get ripped while hanging these over the shower cabinet.

The attached STL 3D-profiles are generated by the programming language OpenSCAD, which makes it convenient to change the model.
